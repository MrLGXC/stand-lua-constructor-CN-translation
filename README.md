# Constructor

A Lua Script for the Stand mod menu for GTA5

Allows for creation of custom vehicles and maps using the in-game props and vehicles, and sharing your creations, and loading others creations.

## Installation

1. Save [Constructor.lua](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hexarobi/stand-lua-constructor/main/Constructor.lua) into `Stand/Lua Scripts`.
2. Run by going to `Stand > Lua Scripts > Constructor`.
3. Select `Load Constructs` and you will be prompted to download and install a [curated collection of construct files](https://github.com/hexarobi/stand-curated-constructs), including popular vehicles, maps, and player skins.
4. Any additional vehicle, map, or player skin files (`json`, `xml` or `ini`) should be saved into `Stand/Constructs`. Subfolders are supported for organization.
